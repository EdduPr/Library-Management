# Library System

This is an ongoing project of a basic library system. I will be updating the project over time with new features.

## Planned Features:
- **Save data to files**: Initially, the system will save book and user data to files.
- **Login system**: Implement a login system for admins and users.
- **New features**: More features will be added soon.
- **Switch to MySQL**: In the future, I plan to migrate the system to use a MySQL database.
- **Graphical interface**: Maybe, in the future, I'll add a graphical interface to make the project even more complete and interactive.

This project is continuously evolving, and improvements are being made as time goes by. Feel free to contribute and follow the progress.
